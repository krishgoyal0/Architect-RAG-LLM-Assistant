# Architect-RAG-LLM-Assistant
A project showcasing AI algorithms and models with a focus on Machine Learning, NLP, and Deep Learning. Includes dataset analysis, debugging, and research-driven enhancements using Python and Data Structures.

#Architect-RAG-LLM-Assistant
An AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant for architecture, urban planning, and building codes.
This project collects, cleans, and processes architecture-related PDFs (case studies, codes, material guides, and references), and prepares them for use in LLM pipelines.

##🚀 Features
📂 Organized dataset → PDFs categorized into:

building_codes

case_studies

material_guide

misc

🧹 Automated PDF Cleaning

Extracts clean text from PDFs (including OCR fallback with Tesseract).

Handles corrupted/empty PDFs gracefully.

📑 Chunking Pipeline

Splits large documents into manageable JSONL chunks for LLM ingestion.

⚡ RAG-ready dataset → Creates clean JSONL outputs for vector database ingestion.

#Requirements
Key dependencies:

pytesseract (OCR support)

pillow (image handling)

transformers (for tokenization / chunking)

torch (LLM support, optional)

pymupdf (PDF reading)

tqdm (progress bar)

See full list in requirements.txt.
